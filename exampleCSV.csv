3,Discovering the Higgs Boson, Physics, 01/07/2012, Maria Smith,On July 4th, 2012, physicists at CERN announced the discovery of a new particle, now known as the Higgs boson. This discovery was made possible through the use of the Large Hadron Collider, which collided protons at high energy in order to search for new particles. The Higgs boson is named after physicist Peter Higgs, who proposed its existence in 1964 as a way to explain the origin of mass in the universe.
4,The Birth of Quantum Mechanics, Physics, 01/01/1900, Albert Einstein,In the early 20th century, a new theory of physics called quantum mechanics was developed. This theory revolutionized our understanding of the fundamental nature of the universe, and has had profound implications for fields such as chemistry, materials science, and computing. Quantum mechanics was developed by a group of physicists, including Max Planck, Niels Bohr, and Erwin Schr√∂dinger, who made pioneering contributions to the field.
5,The Pythagorean Theorem, Mathematics, 01/01/1000, Pythagoras,The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This theorem can be written as a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b are the lengths of the other two sides, and c is the length of the hypotenuse. The Pythagorean Theorem has many important applications in mathematics, including in geometry and trigonometry.
